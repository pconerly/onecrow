I've got a blog! I'm sharing this with the world! What makes me think that a lowly 10kyu's thoughts are valuable to be shared.

I want to improve in Go. I have been fascinated with it for over a decade and it's a mystery that deserves more attention.  I also look at those twelve years of playing occassionally, and I'm sad that I never was disciplined to really improve.  I look at my peers, and there are plenty who have hit the dan level.  I want to understand Go at that level.

Part of improving, on anything, is to practice consciously.  Mindlessly throwing down stones doesn't count, one needs to think about one's moves, and review games.

Reviewing games doesn't require a blog. But I'm also going to be starting Go tutoring, and I'd like to have an easy place to put up my game reviews. And as long as I'm writing reviews for my sensei, why not share it with the world?  Hopefully my opponents (e.g. my friends at the Seattle Go Center) will appreciate the review.

Dear internet reader, I hope you enjoy this journey with me as I struggle up the ranks.
