Burhan and I got into a corner fight. Who's right? Who's wrong? 

<img src="/onecrow/assets/2015-11-11/10kyu-joseki.jpg" />

We were playing a timed game, and both of us spent an inordinant amount of time on this. Which makes sense-- whoever came out on top of this would have really good potential for the rest of the game.  (And an aside, I tend to get into complicated corner problems when I play with Burhan.)

Here's the order:

<div class="center-2col-300">
<div id="joseki_1" class="onecrow s300 glift inline"></div>
<div id="joseki_2" class="onecrow s300 glift inline"></div>
</div>


Joseki dictionaries tells me that my move at <span class="wstone">4</span> is bad.  My indecision to not take the corner with <span class="wstone">10</span> at <span class="bstone">11</span> was also a bad idea.  I was left trying to keep the side, and possibly the center.
      

<div id="joseki_3" class="onecrow s300 glift center"></div>

This is a really bad result.  I ended up losing the game ([spoiler](/onecrow/assets/2015-11-11/game_end.jpg)). So could I have done better?


<div class="center-2col-300">
<div id="joseki_4" class="onecrow s300 glift inline"></div>
<div id="joseki_5" class="onecrow s300 glift inline"></div>
</div>

<span class="wstone">16</span> looks stronger, but we end up in almost the same position. <span class="bstone">23</span> can't be played at <span class="wstone">24</span> to pop my white's eye shape because then white would hane at A and win the capturing race.  Black's group has 3 liberties and white's has 6.

The best I have is for white to try to take the side.

<div id="joseki_6" class="onecrow s300 glift center"></div>

Going off of the previous sequence, white should cut with <span class="wstone">20</span> after the push, giving up the corner and taking the bottom side. Of course, that kind of implies that <span class="bstone">19</span> here is a mistake.  If black plays 19 at 20, the result ends up being similar to the other ones we've seen, with white taking the corner in gote.

I really wasn't able to recover. The Seattle Go Center closed at 10pm, and here's the result when we had to stop.
